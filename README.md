# jsfs-kata-fizzBuzzReverse

## Main objective
Write a function that takes an array as an argument. The function should replace all string values in the array with the correct number in the sequence.
Example: when passing in [0, 1, 2, 'fizz'] it should return [0, 1, 2, 3].

The function must mutate the original array and then return it. It should NOT return a NEW array.

## Test
We have supplied some starter test, but you should write more TDD-style.

## Error handling
Think about edge cases and failing gracefully. E.g., what will happen when you pass an empty array, or an array with only strings.
